Algorithm

1. Take first element as left and last element as right pointers
2. As long as left is less than right pointer calculate mid pointer 
3. Mergesort left part of array. i.e from left to mid
4. Mergesort right part of array. i.e from mid+1 to right
5. Merge left and right sorted arrays

Merge Algorithm

l         le  r   re
1 3 5 7 8 9   2 4 6

Compare a[l] and a[r] and take smallet element into temp.
Increment pointer with smallest value

Temp - 1

---------------


  l       le    r re
1 3 5 7 8 9   2 4 6


Compare a[l] and a[r] and take smallet element into temp.
Increment pointer with smallest value

Temp - 1 2

-----------------


  l       le    r re
1 3 5 7 8 9   2 4 6


Compare a[l] and a[r] and take smallet element into temp.
Increment pointer with smallest value

Temp - 1 2 3
