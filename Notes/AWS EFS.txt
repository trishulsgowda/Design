EFS - Elastic File Storage 

EFS has a mount target. Mount target is an endpoint in the VPC which can be used to access the EFS file system. 
EFS file system cannot be accessed if the mount target is not present.

An EC2 instance can access the EFS file system using the mount target. Mount target will have a security group associated with it which controls the inbound and outbound traffic to the EFS.

An EFS file system can be shared among multiple EC2 instances.
