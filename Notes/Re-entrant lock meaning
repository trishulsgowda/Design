When a thread tries to acquire a lock which it has already acquired, 
It will not block the thread rather it will acquire the same lock again.

For example:

public void method1{
	synchronized(this){ // Lock is acquired here
		method2();
	}
}

public void method2(){
	synchronized(this){  // Lock is acquired again
			// do some work
	}
}
