sum = 5
a[] = {1,2,3,4};

d[i][j] = sum without considering current value || sum by considering current value


Here, sum without considering current value is always the above cell. 
i.e. d[i][j] = d[i-1][j]

For finding sum by considering current value, Lets see an example,
Refer Excel Sheet - For forming a sum 3 with 1,2
Since we are considering current value i.e. 2 remaing value to form sum=3 is 1.

2 + ? = 3

Now, the question is whether we can form sum 1 by ignoring the current value.
Can we form sum=1 with 1 ?
d[i][j] = d[i-1][j-a[i]] 

ALGO: To find whether the given sum is possible or not
dp[a.length][sum+1]
i=0 to a.length-1
j=0 to sum
if(j=0) dp[i][j] = TRUE
if(i=0) dp[0][j-a[i]] = TRUE
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-a[i]]
