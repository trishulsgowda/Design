i = a.length - 1
j = sum

i = 3
j = 5



Stopping condition - if i=0 || sum = 0 print list 

To ignore the current value -
call same function by decrementing i and keeping sum as same.
i--;
sum;

To add current value 
call same function by decrementing i and decrementing sum 
sum = j - a[i]
i--
add a[i] to list.
